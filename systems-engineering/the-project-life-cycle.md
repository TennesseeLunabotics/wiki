# ðŸŒ± The Project Life Cycle

Now that I have (hopefully) convinced you of the necessity of implementing systems engineering practices, let's take a broad look at what a project managed using systems engineering looks like. When we break it down, all large-scale engineering projects typically follow a similar process known as the _project life cycle_. For Lunabotics purposes, we follow a simplified project life cycle like the one shown here, which is just complex enough to help us accomplish our goals while not being too overbearing.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A simplified model of the project life cycle for our purposes.</p></figcaption></figure>

For context, our project life cycle is based on, but not the same as, the one presented in [NASA's Systems Engineering Handbook](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/systems-engineering-handbook/). I will pull and condense a lot of information from this document. For all intents and purposes, this is the Bible for government-aligned space-focused project development.&#x20;

The project life cycle clearly defines activities that happen at each phase of product development. Interspersed throughout the timeline are design reviews, where the team comes together with outside reviewers to run through a total breakdown of the team's progress. Working with this process helps prevent errors from occurring in the first place. It also allows the team to stay one step ahead of any errors that happen to slip by, before they snowball into big resource-wasters.

## Our Example Mission

So, let's take a look at what happens during each phase of the project life cycle. Because I don't want to do the work for you, in this article, I'm going to provide a completely unrelated mission definition to run with. That way, we can walk through the process with examples.

The mission: **Design, build, and demonstrate an unmanned aerial vehicle system that is capable of planting seeds and performing repeated imaging missions to monitor crop health.** Let's also imagine we're given a guidebook with a bunch of additional project requirements like weight, size, power use, bandwidth, and more. We are given that to score more points, our seed-planting needs to be as precise as possible, and our images need to be high quality.

## Pre-Phase A: Concept Studies

NASA says that _"the purpose of Pre-Phase A is to produce a broad spectrum of ideas and alternatives for missions from which new programs/projects can be selected."_ At the beginning of the project, you were given a mission concept along with a bunch of requirements. The main goal at this point is to start brainstorming and coming up with designs that might be able to achieve the goals of your mission. This is known as performing **concept studies.** At the end of this phase, you'll have multiple early concepts that the team will run with for a while.

The first step of this process is to review any and all documentation that you have been provided about your project. For us, this mainly involves the competition guidebook. One harsh truth I've seen in Lunabotics is that people who really want to be involved, but neglect to spend time at the beginning of the year reading through the guidebook, are unable to contribute effectively to the project. They eventually fall off. And this shouldn't be surprising at all - how are you going to solve a problem you don't even understand in the first place? Have the discipline to sit down with the guidebook early on and give it a read through. It's not a memorization game - you'll become more and more familiar with the guidebook over the year - but you need to become familiar _now_ with the overall scope of the competition and important rules like size, weight, and functionality requirements.

After you understand the problem, you can begin producing concepts to perform your mission. These concepts won't be detailed enough for you to know if you satisfy all competition requirements. However, the concepts should be realistic - something a group of college students could put together in a year's time.

Break your team up into 3-5 groups to produce concept studies. Ideally, the teams will place more experienced members alongside new members. Armed with knowledge of the competition rules and requirements, teams should put together a few ideas for possible mission platforms. This process should take no more than a week.

It's a good idea to take ideas from things that already exist. Be sure to review what technologies are already used in the field. In engineering, we classify technologies based on their **technology readiness level (TRL)**. The scale ranges from 1 to 9, with a higher score meaning the technology is more ready to be implemented in the field. An example of TRL 1 technology would be a Dyson swarm satellite system designed to harvest and redirect all the available power from the Sun. An example of TRL 9 technology would be a battery or solar panel. Higher TRL technologies are easier for you to implement.

Some concepts will flop immediately. Some may show promise but be quickly determined to be unfeasible. Some stellar ideas will rise to the top. Don't get an ego or get butthurt if yours fails. The team's goal is not to produce _your_ idea, the team's goal is to produce a _working_ idea. If those two happen to align, great! If not, know that it takes a lot of failed ideas to eventually produce a working idea. Notice I'm not using the words _good_ or _bad_ here - all ideas are good because, even if they don't work, they end up pointing the team closer to the right direction.

Let's assume your team came up with three promising aircraft ideas to perform the mission, a fixed-wing UAV, a quadcopter UAV, and a balloon UAV.
